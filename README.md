## 🛠️ Model Training & Evaluation

- The notebook preprocesses the data, trains a machine learning model, and evaluates its performance.
- Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
- Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation.

## 📊 Results & Visualization

- The model's performance is visualized using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Feature Importance Graphs

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better model accuracy.
- Implementation of deep learning techniques.
- Deployment as an API for real-time fraud detection.
